# Description

This is a simple apple that animates an anolog clock using CSS. The clocks are set to two different time zones.
I use a simple Date object for the local time, but for the different time zones I chose to use the Momentjs and MomentTimeZone libraries. This allowed for seamless integration of the time in to the clock.
